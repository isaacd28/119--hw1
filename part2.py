2b.
Which pipeline has the highest throughput?
Is this what you expected?

=== ANSWER Q2b BELOW ===
The large list pipeline has the highest throughput according to the measured values just like I expected
Throughput is measured in items per second and since the large list has many items, the item processing time is averaged over a huge number of items, giving a higher throughput. 
The small list runs very quickly overall but has fewer items, so the measured throughput is lower in comparison.

===== Questions 6-10: Performance Comparison 1 =====

For our first performance comparison,
let's look at the cost of getting input from a file, vs. in an existing DataFrame.

6. We will use the same population dataset
that we used in lecture 3.

Load the data using load_input() given the file name.

- Make sure that you clean the data by removing
  continents and world data!
  (World data is listed under OWID_WRL)

Then, set up a simple pipeline that computes summary statistics
for the following:

- *Year over year increase* in population, per country

    (min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation)

How you should compute this:

- For each country, we need the maximum year and the minimum year
in the data. We should divide the population difference
over this time by the length of the time period.

- Make sure you throw out the cases where there is only one year
(if any).

- We should at this point have one data point per country.

- Finally, as your answer, return a list of the:
    min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation
  of the data.

Hints:
You can use the describe() function in Pandas to get these statistics.
You should be able to do something like
df.describe().loc["min"]["colum_name"]

to get a specific value from the describe() function.

You shouldn't use any for loops.
See if you can compute this using Pandas functions only.

===== Extra Credit =====

This part is optional.

Use your pipeline to compare something else!

Here are some ideas for what to try:
- the cost of random sampling vs. the cost of getting rows from the
  DataFrame manually
- the cost of cloning a DataFrame
- the cost of sorting a DataFrame prior to doing a computation
- the cost of using different encodings (like one-hot encoding)
  and encodings for null values
- the cost of querying via Pandas methods vs querying via SQL
  For this part: you would want to use something like
  pandasql that can run SQL queries on Pandas data frames. See:
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/45866311/2038713

As your answer to this part,
as before, return
a. the list of 6 throughputs
and
b. the list of 2 latencies.

and generate plots for each of these in the following files:
